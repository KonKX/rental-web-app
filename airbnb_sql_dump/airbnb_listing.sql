Born in the late \'70s, I showed great interest in visual arts and photography at the early age of 8. My favorite pass time since childhood was to capture my personal reality without following the usual norms, always expressing my views in an extravagant and unique way, contrary to what is expected.\r\n\r\nInitially I experimented with small cameras, I later found my true calling with photography through a borrowed zenith. I succeeded in filtering digital photography and it’s processing through digital media, giving a unique identity to my artwork. exploiting the freedom of expression that the digital media makes possible, I ignored what it is perceived as everyday life, capturing reality and exposing it in a new dimension.\r\n\r\nCapturing a clear scene of everyday life by switching its dimensions is the main axis of the seminars instructed by me and what he is continually stating in personal exhibitions and art-events. I have been an instructor of the photography seminars at the student club of the university of Athens. I participated in many exhibitions and art projects. my main geographical areas of photo shooting have been chosen around Europe, USA,Australia and India.','within an hour','100%','100%','f','https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/6719288/profile_pic/1370731750/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70','https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/6719288/profile_pic/1370731750/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70','Attiki',2,2,'[\'email\', \'phone\', \'facebook\', \'reviews\', \'jumio\']','t','t','Filis, Athens, Attica 104 34, Greece','','ΑΓΙΟΣ ΚΩΝΣΤΑΝΤΙΝΟΣ-ΠΛΑΤΕΙΑ ΒΑΘΗΣ','','Athens','Attica','104 34','Athens','GR','Greece',37.99138097608707,23.72892531147921,'t','Apartment','Entire home/apt',3,1,1,2,'Real Bed','{Internet,\"Wireless Internet\",\"Air Conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Smoking Allowed\",\"Elevator in Building\",Heating,\"Family/Kid Friendly\",Washer,Essentials,Shampoo}','','$42.00','$260.00','','','',2,'$7.00',3,1125,'2 weeks ago','t',8,25,55,330,'2015-07-18',58,'2013-07-08','2015-07-15',89,9,9,10,10,8,9,'t','','','f','strict','f','f',2,2.35),(4641619,'https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4641619',20150717184329,'2015-07-18','ATHENS HOUSE HOSTEL, BUDGET HOSTEL',' A FRIENDLY FAMILY YOUTH HOSTEL WITH 13 ROOMS IN CENTRAL ATHENS !!!

I live in the center of Athens for more than 10 years now. I ve traveled a lot though mostly in Europe but also to North Africa and USA. Traveling for me is the most beloved thing to do as I adore to visit other countries and meet  people from foreign and unknown cultures. Being a host to AIR BNB I expect that will give me the opportunity to meet people from all over the world and show them a little bit of Greek culture from the inside to get a more complete essence from the country :) I will certainly try it myself when I go abroad too. I love the center where I live and know many non touristic places to recommend so feel free to ask. I d be happy to help anyone coming to Athens to enjoy the stay here and see as much as possible.

The neighborhood is located north of the historical center of Athens, between Kolonos to the east and Kerameikos to the west, and north of Gazi. Metaxourgeio is frequently described as a transition neighborhood. After a long period of abandonment in the late 20th century, the area is acquiring a reputation as an artistic and fashionable neighborhood due to the opening of many art galleries, museums, and trendy restaurants and cafes. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighborhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. Anonymous art pieces containing quotes and sayings in both English and Ancient Greek have begun springing up throughout the neighborhood, containing statements such as \"Art for art\'s sake\". Guerrilla gardening has also helped to beautify this area, taking advantage of the ample sunshine in Greece. The heart of the neighborhood is Avdi Square, which draws residents and visitors with it','Special services we offer are: - Pickup & dropoff from and to the Airport by one of our screened drivers. €35 - Long stays are possible, ask about the special rates for a month or longer.  - Private \'bodyart\' lessons at home with a licensed instructor at €10 an hour.  - Guided walking tours in Athens: * The Footsteps Tour A tour around the city center and ancient sites.

Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) studied there for twenty years (367 BC – 347 BC) before founding his own school, the Lyceum. The Academy persisted throughout the Hellenistic period as a skeptical school, until coming to an end after the death of Philo of Larissa in 83 BC. Although philosophers continued to teach Plato\'s philosophy in Athens during the Roman era, it was not until AD 410 that a revived Academy was re-established as a center for Neoplatonism, persisting until 529 AD when it was finally closed down by Justinian I.Plato\'s Academy is often said to have been a school for would-be politicians in the ancient world, and to have had many illustrious alumni.
